Project Description:-

While the rate of fatal road accidents has been decreasing steadily since the 80s, the past ten years have seen a stagnation in this reduction. Coupled with the increase in number of miles driven in the nation, the total number of traffic related-fatalities has now reached a ten year high and is rapidly increasing.

By looking at the demographics of traï¬ƒc accident victims for each US state, we find that there is a lot of variation between states. Now we want to understand if there are patterns in this variation in order to derive suggestions for a policy action plan. In particular, instead of implementing a costly nation-wide plan we want to focus on groups of states with similar profiles. How can we find such groups in a statistically sound way and communicate the result effectively?

This project lets you apply skills from:

    Introduction to Shell, including how to navigate the file system and view files
    Data Manipulation with pandas, including reading, exploring, filtering, grouping, and reshaping data
    Merging DataFrames with pandas, including how two merge two DataFrames
    Unsupervised Learning in Python, including KMeans clustering, dimensionally reduction through PCA, and visualizations using matplotlib
    Supervised Learning with scikit-learn, including multivariate regression
    Intermediate Python for Data Science, including visualizations using matplotlib
    Intermediate Data Visualization With Seaborn, including statistical visualizations using seaborn

We recommend that you review the appropriate sections of those courses before starting this project.
Project Tasks

    1 The raw data files and their format
