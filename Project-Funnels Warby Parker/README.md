# Funnels Usage with Warby Parker - SQL

This project is part of a CodeCademy course on SQL. Feel free to check out the code and the presentation. Your feedback is much appreciated.

In this project, we'll use SQL to analyze *dummy* data from Warby Parker, the glasses manufacturer, to come up with insights to increase the sales.

## Quiz Funnel

The first step a customer comes through is to complete a 5-question quiz which represents a style quiz to help customers find their perfect frame. Our funnel analysis here demonstrates the *completion rate for each question* and suggests what might be changed about the quiz to increase the overall completion rate.

## Purchase Funnel

After the style quiz, the customers get to the home try-on stage and then the purchase. Our funnel analysis here demonstrates the conversion rate from each stage to the next and we also conduct an A/B test during the home try-on stage to *find out whether or not users who get more pairs to try on at home will be more likely to make a purchase.*

## Most Common Style

This part of the analysis would get us to know which style is most common when it comes to *quiz answers* and *actual purchases*.
